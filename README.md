# Welcome to Tomo's Data Science Project Space
My name is Tomohiro Ujikawa, a second-year MURP/MPH (CHS) dual degree program student. I worked as a family physician in Japan and South Sudan, and those experiences made me realize how the built environment affects the health of people, especially vulnerable groups. I'm interested in the topic related to both public health (health equity) and the built environment. I do not have any data science experience, so I expect to gain basic skills and knowledge of coding and GIS that can be applicable in my future career.
